# Our Git ethics

1. To clone (download) the repository into your local machine > git clone <repository link - SSH>
  - Ex: git clone git@github.com:amyleena95/internship-guides.git

2. Create a new branch to start working locally (to not mess up with the main branch) > git checkout -b <issue-#issueNum/short-description>
  - Ex: git checkout -b issue-42/create-request-page

3. To check the changes you have made or your current branch > git status
4. To add the changes you have made > git add .
5. To commit > git commit -m "short description #issueNum"
  - Ex: git commit -m "add request page #42"
6. To push (submit) your commits > git push origin <branch-name>
  - Ex: git push origin issue-42/create-request-page
7. Create the pull request using the link generated by the push. Assign the reviewer to either paragasu or amyleena95.

# Important notes
  - Always git pull the main branch before you start working on a new issue. To update your local main branch to the latest code. This is done to avoid conflicts.
  - Always commit any significant changes. Even if your issue is not done yet.
  - Commit message should complete 'if applied, this commit will'. Eg: If applied, this commit will add new feature page. So the commit message should be 'add new feature page'. *git commit -m "add new feature page #issueNum"*
  - Always link you commit to issue number. To make issue tracking easier.
